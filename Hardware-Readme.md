Hardware Update January 2015
============================

Reassembled my latest epoc headset.  The plastic was breaking down with minimal use<br>
   so I redesigned it.  I cut out a piece of cardboard about the size of my palm and<br>
   poked holes in the desired contact points. Then glued a layer of aluminum foil over<br>
   that. Next I cut out a piece of foam and glued that to the cardboard, poking holes<br>
   in the foam.  Then threaded the wires through and glued the contact casings in place<br>
   inset in the foam.  After all contacts were in place, I put a thin layer of glue<br>
   over the foam. This is for when I spray down the contacts, that the foam doesn't get<br>
   saturated. I mounted the battery and the control boards on the back of the unit. <br>
   next i attached an elastic headband to the sides of the unit, so when I place it on<br>
   my head, it is quite snug and there is less worry about the slightest movement<br>
   skewing any results. The device appears to work, however I think the contacts are<br>
   a bit too close together for my liking.  I will post pictures soon.<br><br>
   over all, i'm happy with my design, except I would have spread out the contacts<br>
   more next time. I tested the signal quality in epoc control panel today and it<br>
   was green across the board. Still have some quandary's of what impact the<br>
   locations of the reference sensors are playing, and whether the proximity is<br>
   an issue.<br><br>
   note, if you do decide to take your unit apart, heres some advice that will help you<br>
   out in the long run. 

Modifying your Headset
======================

   1. Take pictures of wiring asap.
   2. carefully saw the plastic, do not pry.
   3. as soon as you get to a bundle of wiring.<br>
      tape them together in a bundle.<br>
   4. as soon as you get to the control boards. refer to step 1. <br>
      and hot glue the contact points of "all" the wires in their place.<br>
      these wires are very brittle and the reason for step 2.   <br>
   5. cut the battery wires one at a time, tape the ends off of the battery<br>
      and put away from your work area. <br>
   6. according to emotiv forums it is counter-intuitive to put sensors<br>
      too close in a cluster as its picking up groups of neurons firing at once.<br>
   7. elastic headband approach works well. plus can give you alternate sites<br>
      for testing.<br>
   
The pictures below are images from my "old" epoc headset that is no longer
with us. lets just say it didnt make it past step 5.
