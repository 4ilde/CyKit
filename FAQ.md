Sensor Questions
================
* Can I remove the felt pads in the contact sensors?
   Yes.

* How do I remove the sensor contact?
   Turn the black contact a quarter-turn, do not over-tighten!

* What are the sensor contacts made out of?
   gold coated with a polymer

* Is the (green)Oxidation of the Contacts normal?
   Yes. The polymer is just a host for elecrochemically active material which reacts with the salt water. This is normal

* What maintenance can i perform on my sensors? 

  Quantity of 0.4% to 0.9% saline.<br>
  Small quantity (50 mil) pure isopropyl alcohol.<br>
 Six good quality cotton (ear) buds.<br>

   Following the instructions provided by Emotiv systems, remove all of the contacts from the headset arms (or fingers). Remove the
   felt pads and soak them in a flat dish with about 2 mm of saline on the bottom. While the felt pads are soaking, wet a cotton bud
   with the alcohol and rub the gold contact in the felt pad holder. If there is a buildup of salts, let it soak a while and try
   again later. If necessary, flush out any debris from the salts using either alcohol or saline. IMPORTANT: Never use any type of
   sharp item to scrape the salts off. Even the smallest scratch will damage the contact and the underlying metal will be destroyed
   in time by the electrolysys process. Once all the gold contacts have been cleaned, you should now revive the felt pads. I have
   noticed (in the dry Australian summer) that the salts build up within the internal felt structure as vertical columns. You can
   often detect this by squeezing the pad sideways and then comparing that to squeezing it vertically. If it appears brittle or is
   noticeably stiffer when you compress it vertically, this is a good indication there is a columnar buildup. If needed, fully
   saturate the pad in saline for ten minutes then carefully squeeze it vertically to half its height then reshape it round again.
   If you flatten it too much, the pad may break apart. Repeat this a few times for each pad. You should notice a significant
   increase in comfort when you next use the headset. One at a time, shake off the excess saline from the pad and re-insert it into
   itâ€™s holder. Screw the holder and pad assembly into the socket on the headset arm. At all times, you should avoid letting any
   liquid get into the electronics. Connect   everything up again and test the headset with the Emotiv Control Panel. DISCLAIMER:
   While the above process has worked very well for me, it is your responsibility to enure it is suitable for your needs.
   
   
* Do the sensor wires contain voltage?
  No. The battery operates the detection electronics, signal processing microprocessor and the wireless transmitter.

* Is it possible to damage my gold sensor contact?
 Yes! Do not clean the contact plate with anything. There is a polymer layer there which contains the materials required for low-noise electrolytic contact. A bit of green on it does no harm at all. 

* What is the headset made out of?
   a polypropylene

* What is the headset arms made of?
   a  polycarbonate

* What frequency does the epoc headset operate at?
   2.4ghz, same as a cordless phone or wireless device.
   epoc+ and Insight utilizes bluetooth
   

* Why is there 16 contacts?
   There are 14 voltage sensor points on EPOC, measuring voltages relative to one of the two reference points. The other reference     point is used to cancel background noise, which is why there are 16 sensors. 

* What data does Cykit give me?
  
  Same functionality as emoKit.
  Streams the raw data from the channels of the headset

* What data does Cykit not give me?

 Processed data, i.e data that has been sifted through identifying
  key patterns related to facial expressions and muscle movements.

* Do I need an arduino controller (i.e. Raspberry Pi)?

 No. Plug in Emotiv USB dongle and it should connect.

* Why did you change emoKit to CyKit?
  
   I've been wanting to change it for a long time and I thought
   CyKit sounded cool. I take absolutely no credit in creating the core 
   emoKit files (Except for the socket streaming.) I also mean no
   disrespect to the authors by changing the name and would like to 
   thank them for their work.
