CyKit FAQ
==========

* What data does Cykit give me?
  
  Same functionality as emoKit.
  Streams the raw data from the channels of the headset

* What data does Cykit not give me?

 Processed data, i.e data that has been sifted through identifying
  key patterns related to facial expressions and muscle movements.

* Do I need an arduino controller (i.e. Raspberry Pi)?

 No. Plug in Emotiv USB dongle and it should connect.

* Why did you change emoKit to CyKit?
  
   I've been wanting to change it for a long time and I thought
   CyKit sounded cool. I take absolutely no credit in creating the core 
   emoKit files (Except for the socket streaming.) I also mean no
   disrespect to the authors by changing the name and would like to 
   thank them for their work.
