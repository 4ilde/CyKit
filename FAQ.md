Emokit FAQ
==========

* What data does emokit give me?

  Streams the raw data from the channels of the headset

* What data does emokit not give me?

 Processed data, i.e data that has been sifted through identifying
  key patterns related to facial expressions and muscle movements.
  emokit is a low level access tool.

* Does emokit work with all emotiv headsets?

 As far as we know, yes. If it doesn't work with yours, file an issue
  on the github project (http://github.com/openyou/emokit/issues)

 Emokit should now work for any USB key. Note that the encryption
  happens on the USB key, and not the headset. It is tied into
  whatever you have plugged in regardless of the headset.

* Do I need an arduino controller?

 No. Plug in Emotiv USB dongle and it should connect.
